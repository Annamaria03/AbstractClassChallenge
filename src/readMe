This is again Tim #Buchalka's latest Abstract Class challenge
and my half way solution tracked on my way of dusting of my coding abilities.
The reason of uploading my solution at this poor condition is to reflect the truth of my current stage.
(Reminder: Internet is perfect tool to track a progress, i love it).
I am badly missing the addItem to order method, I will study T.B's solution, no need to promise that..
Anyway, this result doesn't upsets me because my mind and body in a heavy strike against many things.
So, a fat week ago with spinning head and an enormous amount of
mental suffering what lack of my logic caused, I just quit.
But came back to prove, because I want to see from what depth I can call back my knowledge to the surface (<- Î¨ thing..)
(and I saw today a cheeky MySql query, that really got me to flip my notebook)
So, I actually after that long week of break from coding I made it work.
The structure is standing for itself, and I could put together the abstractness from rubbish as I left.
Not a big deal, i know, but for me it was, i had the "I can make it and I made it" feeling. I understand.
and the missing method, that's juts matter of time and amount of practice of writing algorithms..
That's all.
still NoXoXoMe..
and yes, it felt good. "You see, Annamaria.. "
